# MLP-HPC Optimization Project

## 📌 Project Context
This project focuses on the implementation, optimization, and parallelization of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in C within a High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment.

The work includes:
- Memory profiling using **Valgrind** and **Callgrind**
- Training optimization: mini-batch, activation functions, learning rate schedules
- Parallelization using:
  - **OpenMP** (shared-memory)
  - **MPI** and hybrid **MPI + OpenMP** (distributed-memory)
- Performance benchmarking and speedup analysis

This project was developed as part of the HPC module and aims to explore both algorithmic and system-level optimization techniques.
